```

Here is the clue:

So we just need to right click the mouse and inspect the page for viewing the flag:

So, the flag is:

```
Username: natas1

```

So, with the given clue, I know that the flag is in the source code but we can't inspect the page with rightclicking:

![Clue for Natas 1](images/Clue_1.png)

Instead of rightclicking, we can use the shortcut to inspect the source code:

So, we have to find another page by first viewing the source code:

![Clue for Natas 2](images/Clue_2.png)

I saw that there is a image in used "files/pixel.png" and I also see the folder "files".
I go to the link http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/ for viewing all the files in that directory and suprisingingly, I saw 2 files:

![Clue 2.1 for Natas 2](images/Clue_2.1.png)

Hmmm, then I saw the file user.txt is suspicious, and click it to view the file:

```

![Clue for Natas 3](images/Clue_3.png)

So, if you have experienced enough in doing challenges then you will know this hint refer to the file robots.txt.
Then, I try to go to http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt, and there is a small hint about the directory that won't be displayed or crawled on Google:

![Clue 3.1 for Natas 3 ](images/Clue_2.png)

Then, I access the URL http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/, and we can see that there is a users.txt file which store the flag:

![Flag for Natas 3](images/Answer-3.png)
