## Natas Level 0

```
Username: natas0
Password: natas0
URL:      http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org
```

Here is the clue:

![Clue for Natas 0](images/Clue_0.png)

So we just need to right click the mouse and inspect the page for viewing the flag:

![Flag 0](images/Answer-0.png)

So, the flag is:

```
g9D9cREhslqBKtcA2uocGHPfMZVzeFK6
```

## Natas Level 1

The details to login the natas 1 are:

```
Username: natas1
Password: g9D9cREhslqBKtcA2uocGHPfMZVzeFK6
URL:      http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org
```

So, with the given clue, I know that the flag is in the source code but we can't inspect the page with rightclicking:

![Clue for Natas 1](images/Clue_1.png)

Instead of rightclicking, we can use the shortcut to inspect the source code:

```
Shift + Control + C
```

Here is the flag after I use the shortcut to inspect:

![Flag 1](images/Answer-1.png)

So, the flag is:

```

```

## Natas 2

The details to login the natas 2 are:

```
Username: natas2
Password: h4ubbcXrWqsTo7GGnnUMLppXbOogfBZ7
URL:      http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org
```

When entering the page, it said "There is nothing on this page".
So, we have to find another page by first viewing the source code:

![Clue for Natas 2](images/Clue_2.png)

I saw that there is a image in used "files/pixel.png" and I also see the folder "files".
I go to the link http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/ for viewing all the files in that directory and suprisingingly, I saw 2 files:

![Clue 2.1 for Natas 2](images/Clue_2.1.png)

Hmmm, then I saw the file user.txt is suspicious, and click it to view the file:

![Flag for Natas 2](images/Answer-2.png)

There is a small hint that tell all the following information is listed in the format "username:password". I see all the login credentials of natas3 and other people.
So, the flag from the above screenshot is:

```
